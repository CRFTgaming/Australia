Re spawn after death is still not working if you are not in infastar list **really the only prob holding back from alpha launch **
	**fixed the Y-menu teleporting 
	
Menus are not working for interaction same with the Y-menu its not working **idk if both probs are related to infastar and if it needs to be reinstalled	
		Ace - Y menu works just fine for me. And windows key works just fine for me as well though i have not tested since changes to infistar but has been within the week.
		Apparently this has been fixed per Doppler. Jivesucka is still having issues with accessing the y menu.
		
Medic helicopters keep trying to spawn on non existant hospitals.

Tried to sync TFR mod files to Github but it constantly fails to sync. may needing fixed or at the least revert/removable.

- Cop clothing and weapon shops aren't working.
- Jonzie car mod needs Tundra's expertise. There is addional script work for setting up vehicle colors. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=561566896&searchtext= 
- Medic Heli spawns still need fixed.
- Subaru PD won't spawn in cop vehicle shop. Vanilla vehicles work just fine so it is not the spawn point.
